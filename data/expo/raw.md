### &raquo; Grip and Pan Input Device (Grapid)

Device consists of an two-dimensional plane upon which a top-shaped joystick is suspended. Motion in two dimensions is performed much like a typical computer mouse. Instead of clicking a button, there are three vertical levels provided for:

1. Constant upwards lift on the joystick allows the joystick to be repositioned without moving the cursor.
2. Standard position moves the cursor as the joystick is moved.
3. Engaged position for selecting an area or dragging and dropping items, much like the primary mouse button.

That is where the similarities to a standard mouse end. The joystick should support actions based on rotation and tilt actions for a total of six (2 rotation and 4 directional tilt) additional customizeable actions. Based on imagining using such a device, I presume it would make complex text operations more intuitive. Think of selecting a range of text and moving it, or throwing it to the clipboard with a tilt and pasting with another tilt. Indenting and outdenting with a simple rotation.
