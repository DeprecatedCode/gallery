Concepts that I have interest in, physical products I wish existed, among others.

## Computing Hardware

### &raquo; Grip and Pan Input Device

Device consists of an two-dimensional plane upon which a top-shaped joystick is suspended. Motion in two dimensions is performed much like a typical computer mouse. Instead of clicking a button, there are three vertical levels provided for:

1. Constant upwards lift on the joystick allows the joystick to be repositioned without moving the cursor.
2. Standard position moves the cursor as the joystick is moved.
3. Engaged position for selecting an area or dragging and dropping items, much like the primary mouse button.

That is where the similarities to a standard mouse end. The joystick should support actions based on rotation and tilt actions for a total of six (2 rotation and 4 directional tilt) additional customizeable actions. Based on imagining using such a device, I presume it would make complex text operations more intuitive. Think of selecting a range of text and moving it, or throwing it to the clipboard with a tilt and pasting with another tilt. Indenting and outdenting with a simple rotation.

## Design

### Bathroom Sink

My bathroom sink's poor shape is on a quest to deform my spine and detract from my overall enjoyment of life. I would much prefer a height-adjustable sink with the following characteristics:

1. Water available at the correct (variable) height so anyone can wash my hands without straining spine.
2. Basin may also move vertically at a slower relative speed than the faucet to facilitate wider and narrower gaps as needed.
3. Around the basin there is a secondary collection basin flange.
4. Faucet not directly connected to the basin to facilitate easy cleaning.
5. Lever to raise and lower sink is lockable and easy to adjust with normal force.

### Composable Sofa

The average sofa is too heavy, too bulky, and good for just a few years before it ends up on the side of the road. I would like a sturdy sofa that can be disassembled and reassembled in just a few minutes..

### Automatic Shower

Why do our cars go through the carwash but we ourselves have to take manual showers? CRAZY RIGHT?! All we need is a vertical cylinder with a ring that surrounds you and has 36 water jets pointing inwards and moves on a rack and pinion movement!!!
