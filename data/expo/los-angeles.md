# Los Angeles

Inside are highlights from exploratory days and nights out by [Karla](/who/karla) and I in and around Los Angeles.

## Coffee

### &raquo; [Cafe Daroo](http://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-daroo-los-angeles) <span class="stars">@@@@@</span>

* First visit: August 4th, 2012
* Price: $5-$6 for drinks, $7-$10 for meals
* The good: Frozen mocha that has to be tasted to be believed, truly one-of-a-kind
* The bad: At a busy intersection, street parking could be hard to find

This Koreatown coffee and light food cafe is a true gem of solitude and harmony among the incessant noise of the city. We live in a fairly busy neighborhood; hardly a night or morning goes by without constant car alarms, construction, and the like. Choose a table in the upstairs seating area, take in the ambiance, the live music in the evenings, the smell and flicker of candles, and you're well on your way to a relaxing and enjoyable evening.

## Indian / Fusion

* Price: $7-$9 for  meals
