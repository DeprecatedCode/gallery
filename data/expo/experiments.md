# Experiments

Usually done over a caffeine-fueled zealous all-nighter or two, here are all the things I started working on before considering if they were useful or not.

## Artificial Intelligence

### &raquo; Visual Matrix Brain

While falling far short of Heather Arthur's neural network library [brain.js](http://harthur.github.com/brain/) in just about every way, mine gets points for having sweet colors and being able to see the brain live "at work" in a canvas. View a [demo](/what/matrix-brain) and keep in mind that this is just the beginning. Features I intend to add include adding selection pressure to brain evolution by retaining mutations that perform well against a predefined test. Eventually, I intend to have the brain controlling a small player in a game with simple commands and rank it's effectiveness at retrieving items in a maze.
