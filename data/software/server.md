# Server Software

These applications handle networking, caching, and load balancing when deploying a web application to one or more servers.

## Nginx

[Nginx](http://wiki.nginx.org/) is a free, open-source, high-performance HTTP server and reverse proxy. Because it uses an asynchronous event system to handle requests instead of spawning new threads, it can perform under much higher loads than traditional server software.
