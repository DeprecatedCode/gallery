# Malawi

Some of my best friends are in Malawi. My geologist friend Hilton Banda and I started a small computer sales shop in Zomba, Malawi called <a href="http://akatswiri.com">Akatswiri Computers and Electronics</a>. I lived in the Zomba military base for 5 months, I am planning on showcasing some of my best experiences there on this page, which did in fact include herding cattle.
